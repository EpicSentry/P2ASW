	"MailBody1A"	"Sorry I couldn't contact you earlier.  We found a tunnel those things are using to spread out all over the colony.  We rigged an old warhead.  We're gonna try to seal off the tunnel with the blast."
	"MailBody1B"	"We also got some alarming mails from Laura Callen.  I can't imagine how bad it must be up there.  Helen, for Christ's sake, stay away from the labs!  Lock yourself in until I get back to the main complex."
