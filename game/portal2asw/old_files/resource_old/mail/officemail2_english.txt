I am getting tired of having to ask for this each time something comes up.  You should be keeping me updated on a regular basis."
	"MailBody1C"	"I just returned from Timor Station.  There's another report of two missing miners.  Sounds vaguely like a security issue.  So why haven't I seen any of your staff down there?"

I'm also ordering further IA personnel to Vereon XII in order to obtain a clear picture of the situation.  I will expect you to meet me at 1100 at reception."
