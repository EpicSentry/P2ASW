	"Headline"	"Expansion Act 50th Anniversary"
	"HeadlineDate"	"02/12/52"
	"Paragraph1"	"Celebrations were held across the Interstellar Alliance today, showing support for the Interstellar Expansion Act of 2202.  This wildly successful directive allows any registered entity to claim planets, moons and even entire star systems by right of first discovery."
	"Paragraph2"	"The Act has been heavily used by major corporations, spurring expansion and colonization unseen in human history.  The Act was put into place to encourage people to leave Earth, after dangerous overcrowding and high living costs put the homeworld's stability in danger."
	"Paragraph3"	"A number of demonstrators were arrested outside the IA Central Embassy after they picketed the building, claiming the Act is responsible for fractioning humanity, citing the Chosen and the Humanist Protectorate as prime examples.  A number of extremists also blame the Act and the IA for exposing humanity to the Swarm."
	"Paragraph4"	"The celebrations were sponsored and organized by Trust Media, Paradise Supplies, United Industries and the SynTek Megacorporation, with a spokeman stating 'Relax, have fun, show your support!  Then come to one of our recruitment centres and embrace the future!'"
